started by creating a function addflower
created a push and pop and within those variables I added translate, scale, nostroke, a for let statement, the actual triangle, the rotate
in set up function added angleMode degrees to work in degrees
then created objects in the set up function and created flower1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
within these flowers I defined the x, y, scale, fill, point, and start angle
then in the draw function I called addflower and added flower1 within the ()
i repreated this for flower2, 3, 4, and 5
adding ellipses within each flower as the center of the flower

in question 2 created rows vertically and horizontally of different flowers
I created these in the set up function and then called them by addFlower(flower1) and so on
I changed the points on random flowers to randomize the pattern
